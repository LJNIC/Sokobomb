# Fennel Skeleton
My personal skeleton for LÃ–VE projects made with [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/).

The game is run with the `run.py` Python script. It compiles every Fennel file to Lua and runs the game. Afterwards, it deletes all of the Lua files. Using the `-s` flag will keep the Lua files around, and `-l` will stop the game from running. The script will also replace dashes with underscores in table accesses, so that snake case code from other modules (like `batteries`) can still be used with kebab-case.

A config for [makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove) is also included, which calls `run.py` appropriately to generate the required Lua code.
